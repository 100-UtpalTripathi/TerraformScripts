# Terraform Commands Cheat Sheet

This cheat sheet provides a comprehensive overview of the most important Terraform commands, their purposes, and common use cases. Use this as a quick reference while working with Terraform.

---

## **1. `terraform init`**
**Purpose:** Initializes a Terraform project.

- **What it does:**
  - Downloads the necessary provider plugins.
  - Sets up the backend for state management.
  - Initializes any modules used in the configuration.

- **When to use:**
  - First command after creating or cloning a Terraform project.
  - After modifying the provider version or backend configuration.

```bash
terraform init
```

---

## **2. `terraform validate`**
**Purpose:** Validates the syntax and structure of your Terraform configuration files.

- **What it does:**
  - Checks for syntax errors or missing arguments in `.tf` files.
  - Verifies that the configuration matches Terraform rules.

- **When to use:**
  - After writing or modifying your Terraform files.

```bash
terraform validate
```

---

## **3. `terraform plan`**
**Purpose:** Generates and previews the execution plan for the proposed changes.

- **What it does:**
  - Compares the current state and desired state.
  - Shows resources to be created, modified, or destroyed.

- **When to use:**
  - Before applying changes to review and confirm the plan.

```bash
terraform plan
```

---

## **4. `terraform apply`**
**Purpose:** Executes the changes defined in the Terraform configuration.

- **What it does:**
  - Applies the execution plan generated by `terraform plan`.
  - Updates the state file to reflect the new infrastructure.

- **When to use:**
  - After reviewing the execution plan.

```bash
terraform apply
```

- Apply a saved plan:
```bash
terraform apply tfplan
```

---

## **5. `terraform show`**
**Purpose:** Displays the current state or a saved plan in a human-readable format.

- **What it does:**
  - Shows detailed information about the resources in the current state or a specific plan file.

- **When to use:**
  - To inspect the infrastructure managed by Terraform.
  - To review a saved execution plan.

```bash
terraform show
```

---

## **6. `terraform destroy`**
**Purpose:** Destroys all infrastructure managed by the Terraform configuration.

- **What it does:**
  - Deletes the resources defined in your Terraform state file.
  - Updates the state file to reflect the destroyed infrastructure.

- **When to use:**
  - When tearing down a test environment or decommissioning resources.

```bash
terraform destroy
```

---

## **7. `terraform output`**
**Purpose:** Displays the values of output variables.

- **What it does:**
  - Extracts and prints the values defined in the `output` blocks of your Terraform configuration.

- **When to use:**
  - To get details about deployed resources (e.g., IP addresses, URLs).
  - To share resource information with other systems.

```bash
terraform output
```

---

## **8. `terraform state`**
**Purpose:** Interacts with the Terraform state file.

- **What it does:**
  - Allows querying, modifying, or repairing the state file.
  - Subcommands include `list`, `show`, `mv`, and `rm`.

- **When to use:**
  - For troubleshooting state issues or moving resources between configurations.

**Examples:**
- List resources in the state:
```bash
terraform state list
```
- Show details of a resource in the state:
```bash
terraform state show aws_instance.example
```

---

## **9. `terraform fmt`**
**Purpose:** Formats Terraform configuration files according to standard conventions.

- **What it does:**
  - Aligns and organizes `.tf` files for readability and consistency.

- **When to use:**
  - After editing configuration files to maintain clean formatting.

```bash
terraform fmt
```

---

## **10. `terraform import`**
**Purpose:** Brings existing infrastructure into Terraform management.

- **What it does:**
  - Maps an existing resource to a Terraform resource in the state file.

- **When to use:**
  - When starting to manage existing infrastructure with Terraform.

```bash
terraform import aws_instance.example i-1234567890abcdef0
```

---

## **11. `terraform apply -replace`**
**Purpose:** Marks a resource for recreation.

- **What it does:**
  - Flags a resource so that it is destroyed and recreated during the next apply.

- **When to use:**
  - When a resource is in a faulty or inconsistent state.

```bash
terraform apply -replace="aws_instance.example"
```

---

## **12. `terraform graph`**
**Purpose:** Generates a dependency graph of Terraform resources.

- **What it does:**
  - Creates a visual representation of resource relationships.

- **When to use:**
  - To understand complex configurations and dependencies.

```bash
terraform graph | dot -Tpng > graph.png
```

---

## **13. `terraform workspace`**
**Purpose:** Manages multiple workspaces (environments) in Terraform.

- **What it does:**
  - Creates isolated state files for different environments (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`).

- **When to use:**
  - When managing separate environments with the same configuration.

**Examples:**
- Create a workspace:
```bash
terraform workspace new staging
```
- Switch to a workspace:
```bash
terraform workspace select staging
```

---

## **14. `terraform providers`**
**Purpose:** Lists the providers used in the configuration.

- **What it does:**
  - Displays information about providers and their versions.

- **When to use:**
  - To verify provider dependencies and versions.

```bash
terraform providers
```

---

## **15. Typical Workflow**
1. **Initialize the project:**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
2. **Validate configuration:**
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```
3. **Preview changes:**
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
4. **Apply changes:**
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
5. **Inspect the infrastructure:**
   ```bash
   terraform show
   ```
6. **Tear down infrastructure:**
   ```bash
   terraform destroy
   ```
